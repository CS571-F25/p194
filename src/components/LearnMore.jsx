      <p>Urban forestry is important because it improves air and water quality, provides wildlife habitat, and helps combat the urban heat island effect through shade and cooling. It also offers significant benefits for human health, mental well-being, and the economy by increasing property values, creating community spaces, and enhancing physical and mental health.</p>
      <h3>Environmental benefits</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Improved air quality: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and filter air pollutants, improving the overall air quality in a city.
         </li>
         <li>Better water management: Tree root systems help filter water, reduce storm water runoff, control erosion, and decrease the risk of flooding.
         </li>
         <li>Climate change mitigation: By absorbing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, urban forests help reduce the impacts of climate change.
         </li>
         <li>Energy conservation: Trees provide shade, which cools buildings and reduces the need for air conditioning, lowering energy costs.
         </li>
         <li>Wildlife support: Urban forests provide essential food, water, and shelter for a variety of wildlife and act as important stopover points for migrating birds.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Human and economic benefits</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Improved health and well-being: Access to green spaces reduces stress, anxiety, and depression, and encourages physical activity. Studies show that patients with views of trees recover faster and productivity increases in those with views of nature.
         </li>
         <li>Increased property values: Properties in areas with a robust tree canopy have higher values.
         </li>
         <li>Economic advantages: Trees can attract shoppers and boost local economies. The environmental benefits, such as stormwater management and energy reduction, can save cities money.
         </li>
         <li>Enhanced community: Urban forests foster a sense of community, improve the aesthetic appeal of neighborhoods, and can even lead to reduced crime and vandalism.
         </li>
      </ul>
